# Saving and Files

GDDraw distinguishes flattened image output from editable layered project data.

## PNG files

PNG is the final visible image for a single paint target.

- **Save** writes to the current PNG destination.
- **Save As** chooses a new PNG destination.
- PNG output merges visible layers and groups using their opacity.
- Content outside the canvas boundary is not part of the exported image.

PNG cannot preserve the editable layer hierarchy.

## Layered projects

Choose **File > Save Layered Project** to write a `.gddraw` document. It preserves:

- Paint layers and nested groups.
- Layer pixels and out-of-canvas bounds.
- Names, order, visibility, opacity, and locking.
- Per-target canvas dimensions.
- Active target and layer selection.
- 3D hierarchy and material bindings.
- Eraser baselines required for restored 3D texture editing.

For 3D projects, mesh geometry remains in the Godot Scene and is not silently duplicated into the layered file.

## Closing a document

**File > Close** closes or discards the current drawing session; it does not minimize the GDDraw bottom panel. Dirty documents receive Save, Discard, and Cancel protection.

During a 3D hierarchy session, use **Stop Editing** for the consolidated texture review. Ordinary File-menu Save commands are disabled or redirected appropriately so one texture cannot be saved accidentally while other edited targets are overlooked.

## Drag-and-drop

- Drop images into a layered 2D document to create new paint layers.
- Drop images directly into the Layers tree to control their placement.
- Drop Godot Scene nodes into the 3D view to inspect their compatible hierarchy.
- Dragging a complete hierarchy discovers every compatible descendant instead of stopping at the first texture.

## Project storage

By default, project-owned files are separated from replaceable plugin files:

- `res://addons/GDDrawPlus/` contains installed plugin code, icons, and this manual.
- `res://gddraw/images/` contains generated or saved PNG files.
- `res://gddraw/fonts/` is the default custom-font discovery folder.
- `res://gddraw/brushes/` is reserved for file-backed brush assets; parameter-only presets use project editor metadata.
- `user://gddraw/updates/` stores explicitly downloaded update staging and recovery data.

Folders are created lazily when an operation actually needs to write into them.

Use **Edit > Preferences > Files** to change the default blank-canvas dimensions, PNG save folder, or custom-font folder. See [Preferences](preferences.md) for when each default applies and which settings leave existing documents unchanged.

## Safe updates

GDDrawPlus does not update itself: **Help > Check for Updates** only shows a message. To update, delete `res://addons/GDDrawPlus` and unzip the newer release from the project's Releases page in its place.

User-created assets under `res://gddraw/` are outside the replaceable plugin package and are not removed by the updater.
